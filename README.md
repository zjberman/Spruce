Overview:
Spruce is a new social media platform providing an outlet for the diverse and creative projects we take on in our lives. Users may visually document important projects in their lives by uploading images of their progress to Spruce. These images are stored chronologically in 'branches' which represent the entire lifetime of the project. Branches are stored on the user's profile where they may be shared with just their friends, with the whole world, or kept private. Users may also discover new projects by others which they are interested in and follow them to receive updates when a new image is added.
