/**
 * The `member` function creates a new team member.
 *
 * You should use this function to create new "team members". It is a
 * utility function that can be used in other library routines to
 * create new members. It is a useful technique to abstract the
 * creation of data from the actual data representation itself. In
 * this case a *member* is an object with four important properties:
 *
 * `user`: The username of the member. This should be the username
 * of the team member used to login to UMass Spire, Moodle, etc. You
 * will need to ask your fellow team members for their username.
 * `fname`: The first name of a team member.
 * `lname`: The last name of a team member.
 * `year`: Their current year of college (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior)
 *
 * We give you the implementation of this!
 *
 * @param  {string} user  the team member's username
 * @param  {string} fname the team member's first name
 * @param  {string} lname the team member's last name
 * @param  {string} year  the team member's year of college
 * @return {object} { user, fname, lname, year }
