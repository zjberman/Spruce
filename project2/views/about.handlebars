Spruce is a new social media platform providing an outlet for the diverse and creative projects we take on in our lives. Whether it's redesigning your dining room, losing weight, building a treehouse or painting a picture, Spruce is the perfect place to visually document your favorite projects. The application is a visual journey throughout the life of these projects. Here you can view projects by others which you are interested in, as well as share the ones you are most proud of to your profile.

Have you ever watched progress videos on Youtube or found ideas for projects on Pinterest? You may end up on countless different sites trying to find a project you are interested in. Perhaps you want to share a project you are proud of and do not quite know where to go to share this. Spruce is the answer to these questions. Spruce provides the space for sharing and viewing projects of all shapes and sizes. Not only that, but this application makes it easier for us to find the motivation to complete our projects. Reminders to keep up with your progress goals for individual projects, as well as the community, will help motivate us to reach our potential.

What sets Spruce apart from other social media platforms is that we aim to create an application which promotes positive thinking and increases usersâ€™ motivation to reach their goals. Social media nowadays is an outlet of harmful comparisons and competition. Users do not need to share their projects with the world, but are encouraged to because others may find motivation in seeing people reach their goals. Many think that social media is detrimental to our ways of life, but Spruce aims to capture everybody, young and old, into a culture of positivity and determination which one cannot deny will better our collective social health. We hope Spruce, as a project-based hub of motivational energy, can create its own identity as a social media platform, one which will benefit the world.
